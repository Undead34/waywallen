//! Per-renderer release-fence reaper.
//!
//! Owns a Tokio task that drains [`FrameRecord`]s from
//! `display::endpoint::forward_frame_ready`. Each frame fanned out to a
//! consumer produces one record carrying:
//!
//!   - the producer-assigned `release_point` (the timeline value the
//!     producer's later submit will WAIT on before reusing the slot),
//!   - the daemon-allocated binary drm_syncobj handle for THIS consumer
//!     (whose fd was sent to that consumer; the consumer signals it
//!     from its release GPU work),
//!   - `expected_count` — the fan-out width: how many records will
//!     arrive for this `release_point` in total.
//!
//! The reaper buckets records by `release_point`. A bucket is flushed
//! when it has collected `expected_count` records OR when its bucket
//! deadline expires (`BUCKET_TIMEOUT`). On flush:
//!
//!   1. wait for every collected handle to signal (kernel ioctl,
//!      `WAIT_ALL` flag, deadline = `WAIT_TIMEOUT`).
//!   2. if any handle did not signal in time, force-SIGNAL it so the
//!      producer's wait at this `release_point` doesn't deadlock.
//!      The producer may then race against a still-reading consumer,
//!      but a stalled producer is worse than a stale read on a
//!      single-frame static image.
//!   3. TRANSFER from one of the (now-signaled) consumer handles onto
//!      the producer's release timeline at `release_point`. We do not
//!      `SYNC_IOC_MERGE` the per-consumer fences first because, by
//!      construction (step 1 just succeeded), every fence is already
//!      signaled — the producer's wait passes regardless of which one
//!      the timeline ends up holding. The merge would matter for
//!      profiling tools that want to see cumulative wait stats; not a
//!      concern in the prototype.
//!
//! The producer's release timeline syncobj is imported lazily into a
//! daemon-side handle on the first flushed bucket and cached.
